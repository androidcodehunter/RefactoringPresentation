# RefactoringPresentation
This repository provides tips and tricks specially on android refactoring. I prepared the source code for one of my android refactoring presentation. It's a source of information to improve the existing android code by applying refactoring rules. 

Here is the package structure for this presentation code: 
#Comments.java 
This class provides information about to write better comment or Java documentation for your code. 
#exceptions
We know that, in android NullPointerException is very common. This package provides various example of managing exceptions better way.
#myswitchcase
Sometimes we create huge if-else curve to check conditional logic. Thus, we use switch case or if-else curve but we can replace it with Factory Method design pattern. You can find the example in ScreenFactory.java class. 
#Naming.java
We name our class, methods and naming is everywhere. So we should follow naming conventions for Android or Java development. This class provides all sorts of information to name your android code. 
#ClazzesActivity.java
When we clicked on a button, we try to launch a new Activity. Here in this case we create lots of duplicate code but we can avoid it by creating a generic method. 

If you want to use this improvement in your code. Please do a pull. Or if you have any confusion or any suggetion, please let me know.
